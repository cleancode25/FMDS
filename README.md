## **📌 Face Mask Detection System**
This project is a **real-time Face Mask Detection System** that detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not using **Deep Learning and OpenCV**. The system utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model trained on image datasets and integrated with OpenCV for face detection.

## **🚀 Features**
✔️ **Real-time detection** using a webcam  
✔️ **Pre-trained MobileNetV2 model** for mask classification  
✔️ **Face detection with OpenCV**  
✔️ **Custom dataset support** for improved accuracy  
✔️ **Fast and lightweight model** suitable for edge devices

## **📥 Installation**
1️⃣ **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Face-Mask-Detection.git
cd Face-Mask-Detection
```

## **🖥️ How It Works?**
1. **Face detection**: The system detects faces using OpenCV’s Haar Cascade Classifier.  
2. **Preprocessing**: The detected face is resized and normalized.  
3. **Prediction**: The CNN model classifies whether the face has a mask or not.  
4. **Result display**: The result is shown on the screen with a bounding box (green for masks, red for no masks).

## **📊 Dataset**
- The model was trained using a **custom dataset** containing images of masked and unmasked faces.  
- Dataset source: Kaggle, RMFD, and self-curated images.  

---

## **🔬 Model Training**
- We used a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based on **MobileNetV2** for efficient classification.  
- The model was trained using **Keras and TensorFlow** with **Adam optimizer** and **categorical cross-entropy loss**.

## **📌 Future Enhancements**
- Improve **accuracy** by training on a larger dataset.  
- Optimize model for **faster inference** on edge devices.  
- Extend support for **different types of face coverings** like scarves and niqabs.
